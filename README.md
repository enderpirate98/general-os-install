# general-os-install
this guide covers all of the major OSs from windows to mac os to linux this general guide will help you to install the os on real hardware (for running MacOS im not going to cover Hackintoshing just the apple hardware)

In my other guides I usually tell you how to setup an os in a virtual machine but what happens when you want to run this on real hardware, well this guide will not cover the spefics of an individual os installation but you will be able to get started with the install in this guide and then look back at the vm install guides for more specific installation instructions but please note the following: YOU DO NEED TO INSTALL VMWARE TOOLS OR OPEN-VM-TOOLS WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING IT ON REAL HARDWARE.

now for what you need to download is the os specific iso file and a nifty piece of cross platform softare called balena etcher: https://bit.ly/3uEHNNZ

a list of the OSs compatible with this guide are: any Windows iso, Linux distrobution iso or MacOS iso

so install balena etcher and plug in a flash drive

select the flash drive you want to format and select the iso file to extract to that flash drive and hit go

once that is done eject the flash drive and plug it into the computer you want to install it on

make sure the currently installed os reconizes it and reboot

after the os is off mash the computer manufacturer specific keyboard key immediately (don't worry about that you don't know the key just look it up)

just keep mashing the key until you see the manufacturer's logo and you see something a bit different this time

congrats you have just entered the bios!

go through the menu disabling secure boot if you are installing linux but with windows leave secure boot on

go through the menu until you see an option to boot from usb and press enter

you will then see the os install screen

go back to the vm install guide and follow from there but DO NOT INSTALL VM TOOLS ON REAL HARDWARE!

Congrats you just installed an os on a computer! Are you proud of yourself?
